    <p>Cats are the best pets to have in your house. They are smart, independent, and intelligent. They can use the bathroom on their own (without you having to take them outside in the worst weather possible!) They are cuddly and serve as a personal heating pad and companion.

    <p>Here are a few of the different types of cats:</p>
